# Labarotory work on long integer

- create Integer from all int types
- comparison of Integers
- convert Integer to base int types
- Binary and unar operators between Integer
- write Integer to console with cout

- in the start of the program you have to specify uint64_t biginteger::Integer::BASE, this will be applied to all of your Integers, BASE is 10 ^ n, where n is number of digits in one cell of Integer, min BASE is 10 and max is 1000000000
